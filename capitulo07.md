# Chapter 7 â€“ Semantic Analysis

Now that we have completed construction of the AST, we are ready to
begin analyzing the semantics, or the actual meaning of a program, and
not simply its structure.

**Type checking** is a major component of semantic analysis. Broadly
speaking, the type system of a programming language gives the program-
mer a way to make verifiable assertions that the compiler can check auto-
matically. This allows for the detection of errors at compile-time, instead
of at runtime.
